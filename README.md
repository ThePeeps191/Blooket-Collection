# Introduction
Hey, welcome to my repository. This repository is a collection of Blooket cheats. 

# How To Use
All code in this repository is run and tested in the console (crtl + shift + j). If you want to run this copy any code you want to use and paste in the console.

How to open the console? Press __crtl + shift + j__.

Anyways lets get started.

# Get answers
This folder gives you access to getting answers from **LIVE** quiz only. I know a way for private a private quiz but I don't want to leak the source code on this repository. But if you want to use the cheat for private quiz can join this discord server --> https://discord.gg/bGRN82QQYM

- [answer.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answer.js) file logs the answers in the console (without images).
- [answersUI.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answersUI.js) files shows you a button to show answers on a quiz (images included)
- [getAnswersHWLink.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/getAnswersHWLink.js) file gives you answers to only a **HOMEWORK LINK** assignment. (logs answers in console, if i have time i'll make it the same as [answersUI.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answersUI.js))

# Other Cheats
Besides the answers cheat there is other fun cheats you can troll with. 
- [flood.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Flood/flood.js) files lets you flood a **LIVE** blooket game(s).
- [kick.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Kick/kick.js) files lets you kick a player from a **LIVE** blooket game(s).
- [addTokens.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Tokens/addTokens.js) or add coins. This is kind of self-explanatory, i'll still explain what this cheat does. It adds tokens/coins to you blooket account. **MAXIMUM 500 A DAY**. 
- [unlockBlook.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Blooks/unlockBlook.js) files lets you unlock a blook from one of the boxes. (This uses your coins/tokens)

# Other Folder
The files in [Other](https://github.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/tree/main/Other) folder is just random stuff i'll probably need to make more cheats. I'll probably be updating that folder a lot so be on a look out :).
