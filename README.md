# Introduction
Hey, welcome to my repository. This repository is a collection of Blooket cheats. 

# How To Use
All code in this repository is run and tested in the console (crtl + shift + j). If you want to run this copy any code you want to use and paste in the console.

How to open the console? Press __crtl + shift + j__.

Anyways lets get started.

# Answers Folder
This folder gives you access to getting answers from **LIVE** quiz only. I know a way for private a private quiz but I don't want to leak the source code on this repository. But if you want to use the cheat for private quiz can join this discord server --> https://discord.gg/bGRN82QQYM

- [answer.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answer.js) file logs the answers in the console (without images).
- [answersUI.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answersUI.js) files shows you a button to show answers on a quiz (images included)
- [getAnswersHWLink.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/getAnswersHWLink.js) file gives you answers to only a **HOMEWORK LINK** assignment. (logs answers in console, if i have time i'll make it the same as [answersUI.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Answers/answersUI.js))
