This cheat is basically a troll, it uses blookets API to unlock a blook. I couldn't find a way to unlook blooks for free but atleast this troll works. (Troll only for people who don't have any programming language or people who can't read javascript haha).

# How to use
Copy the code from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glixzzy/Blooket-Collection/main/Blooks/unlockBlook.js and paste it into the console. To open console press crtl + shift + j.
